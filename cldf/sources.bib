    abstract = {Around the world, more than 7,000 languages are spoken, most of them by small populations of speakers in the tropics. Globalization puts small languages at a disadvantage, but our understanding of the drivers and rate of language loss remains incomplete. When we tested key factors causing language attrition among Papua New Guinean students speaking 392 different indigenous languages, we found an unexpectedly rapid decline in their language skills compared to their parents and predicted further acceleration of language loss in the next generation. Language attrition was accompanied by decline in the traditional knowledge of nature among the students, pointing to an uncertain future for languages and biocultural knowledge in the most linguistically diverse place on Earth.Papua New Guinea is home to \&gt;10\% of the world{\textquoteright}s languages and rich and varied biocultural knowledge, but the future of this diversity remains unclear. We measured language skills of 6,190 students speaking 392 languages (5.5\% of the global total) and modeled their future trends using individual-level variables characterizing family language use, socioeconomic conditions, students{\textquoteright} skills, and language traits. This approach showed that only 58\% of the students, compared to 91\% of their parents, were fluent in indigenous languages, while the trends in key drivers of language skills (language use at home, proportion of mixed-language families, urbanization, students{\textquoteright} traditional skills) predicted accelerating decline of fluency to an estimated 26\% in the next generation of students. Ethnobiological knowledge declined in close parallel with language skills. Varied medicinal plant uses known to the students speaking indigenous languages are replaced by a few, mostly nonnative species for the students speaking English or Tok Pisin, the national lingua franca. Most (88\%) students want to teach indigenous language to their children. While crucial for keeping languages alive, this intention faces powerful external pressures as key factors (education, cash economy, road networks, and urbanization) associated with language attrition are valued in contemporary society.All data used for the analysis are included in the article, the SI Appendix, and Datasets S1 and S2.},

    abstract = {Is there a universal hierarchy of the senses, such that some senses (e.g., vision) are more accessible to consciousness and linguistic description than others (e.g., smell)? The long-standing presumption in Western thought has been that vision and audition are more objective than the other senses, serving as the basis of knowledge and understanding, whereas touch, taste, and smell are crude and of little value. This predicts that humans ought to be better at communicating about sight and hearing than the other senses, and decades of work based on English and related languages certainly suggests this is true. However, how well does this reflect the diversity of languages and communities worldwide? To test whether there is a universal hierarchy of the senses, stimuli from the five basic senses were used to elicit descriptions in 20 diverse languages, including 3 unrelated sign languages. We found that languages differ fundamentally in which sensory domains they linguistically code systematically, and how they do so. The tendency for better coding in some domains can be explained in part by cultural preoccupations. Although languages seem free to elaborate specific sensory domains, some general tendencies emerge: for example, with some exceptions, smell is poorly coded. The surprise is that, despite the gradual phylogenetic accumulation of the senses, and the imbalances in the neural tissue dedicated to them, no single hierarchy of the senses imposes itself upon language.},

    abstract = {Demographic change of human populations is one of the central questions for delving into the past of human beings. To identify major population expansions related to male lineages, we sequenced 78 East Asian Y chromosomes at 3.9 Mbp of the non-recombining region, discovered >4,000 new SNPs, and identified many new clades. The relative divergence dates can be estimated much more precisely using a molecular clock. We found that all the Paleolithic divergences were binary; however, three strong star-like Neolithic expansions at ∼6 kya (thousand years ago) (assuming a constant substitution rate of 1×10−9/bp/year) indicates that ∼40% of modern Chinese are patrilineal descendants of only three super-grandfathers at that time. This observation suggests that the main patrilineal expansion in China occurred in the Neolithic Era and might be related to the development of agriculture.},

Though there are conflicting hypotheses regarding its origin, the most widely held view is that Bos frontalis originated from direct domestication of Bos gaurus (gaur). To study this, we analysed mtDNA control region and cytochrome b gene sequences of 41 B. frontalis from China and India, together with the available sequences in the public databases. Bayesian inference revealed clustering of B. frontalis and B. gaurus sequences into two separate clades. Application of relaxed molecular clock to these clades shows that B. frontalis and B. gaurus diverge between 0.134 and 0.207 million years ago. This time estimate lies much outside the ∼10,000-year-old history of animal domestication. Based on this finding, we argue that B. frontalis should be treated as a separate species/sub-species and not merely a domestic form of B. gaurus. Our study also highlights the gene flow between domestic cattle and B. frontalis population.},

    abstract = {Recent ancient DNA analyses have revealed the origins of European and Near Eastern domestic cattle. In East Asia, however, only a few ancient cattle remains from Korea have been studied. The origins of East Asian domestic cattle and the genetic contribution by ancient cattle to modern cattle are still unclear. To provide new insight into the early history of East Asian domestic cattle, we analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 53 cattle remains, aged between 4500 and 2300 years, excavated from five archaeological sites in Northern China. All ancient Chinese cattle were identified as belonging to taurine cattle. On the one hand, the results support the previous hypothesis that taurine cattle spread into Northern China between 3000 and 2000 BC; on the other hand, the results suggest that zebu cattle did not spread into the Central Plains until at least 1500 BC. Three haplogroups T2, T3, and T4 were present in the ancient Chinese cattle, of which T3 was predominant (79.3%), while T2 and T4 were less common (9.4% and 11.3% respectively). Considering the geographic origin and estimated age of mtDNA haplogroups and the archaeological record of cattle remains in China, our results suggest that Chinese domestic cattle originated from the Near East and were already introduced into the Central Plains around 2500--1900 BC. Furthermore, phylogenetic network analysis indicates that the haplogroup distribution pattern of ancient Chinese cattle is similar to that of modern East Asian taurine cattle, suggesting a genetic continuity from the Bronze Age to present day. Lastly, population pairwise FST distance analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis also support close genetic relationship between ancient Chinese cattle and modern East Asian taurine cattle. All these results suggest that ancient Chinese cattle made an important contribution to the gene pool of modern East Asian taurine cattle.},

Through analysing the genomes of 49 modern breeds and eight East Asian ancient samples, worldwide cattle are consistently classified into five continental groups based on Y-chromosome haplotypes and autosomal variants. We find that East Asian cattle populations are mainly composed of three distinct ancestries, including an earlier East Asian taurine ancestry that reached China at least ~3.9 kya, a later introduced Eurasian taurine ancestry, and a novel Chinese indicine ancestry that diverged from Indian indicine approximately 36.6-49.6 kya. We also report historic introgression events that helped domestic cattle from southern China and the Tibetan Plateau achieve rapid adaptation by acquiring ~2.93% and ~1.22% of their genomes from banteng and yak, respectively. Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of cattle and the importance of introgression in adaptation of cattle to new environmental challenges in East Asia.},

The neighbour-joining phylogeny and the reduced median network analysis showed that Yunnan gayal originated from the hybridization between male Bos frontalis and female Bos taurus or Bos indicus, and that Yunnan cattle mostly originated from B. indicus, also containing some hybrids of male B. indicus and female B. taurus. The phylogenetic pattern of Yunnan cattle was consistent with the recently described cattle matrilineal pool from China and indicated more contribution to the Yunnan cattle from B. indicus than from B. taurus.},

Previous studies have revealed a general tendency for populations of livestock species to include deeply divergent maternal lineages, indicating that they were domesticated in multiple, independent events from genetically discrete wild populations.

These hypotheses have rarely been rigorously tested because of a lack of sufficient wild samples. To investigate the origin of the domestic yak (Poephagus grunnies), we analyzed 637 bp of maternal inherited mtDNA from 13 wild yaks (including eight wild yaks from a small population in west Qinghai) and 250 domesticated yaks from major herding regions.},

    abstract = {Large herbivores are keystone species on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), but their past population ecology is the product of a complex combination of climatic changes and human activities that span the Holocene. In this study we use the record of dung-residing fungal spores (Sporormiella) in the stratified lake sediments of Genggahai Lake in the northeastern QTP to track changes in large herbivore populations. We hypothesize that the abundance of Sporormiella spores would decrease with the reduction of herbivore populations with the retreat of the summer monsoon after the mid-Holocene and the resulting vegetation degradation which is indicated by the pollen record. However, our results reveal an increase in Sporormiella spores after 5.7 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), suggesting an increase in herbivore populations. Combined with regional archeological evidence, we infer that hunter--gatherers may have influenced the regional herbivore ecology and that the early Tibetan people may have domesticated or managed yaks and other herbivores in the northeastern QTP since 5.7 ka. The records of Sporormiella spores are interpreted within a robust chronostratigraphic framework provided by numerous radiocarbon dates from regional archeological sites, and the representation of Sporormiella spores during the Tang Dynasty is tested by a comparison with historical records of the livestock population of the region. Our findings potentially improve understanding of early human adaptation to environmental changes and past herbivore-steppe ecology in the QTP during the Holocene.},

Zebu and taurine breeds are differentiated primarily by the presence or absence of a hump and have been recognized as separate species (Bos indicus and Bos taurus). However, the most widely held view is that both types of cattle derive from a single domestication event 8000-10,000 years ago. We have examined mtDNA sequences from representatives of six European (taurine) breeds, three Indian (zebu) breeds, and four African (three zebu, one taurine) breeds. Similar levels of average sequence divergence were observed among animals within each of the major continental groups: 0.41\% (European), 0.38\% (African), and 0.42\% (Indian). However, the sequences fell into two very distinct geographic lineages that do not correspond with the taurine-zebu dichotomy: all European and African breeds are in one lineage, and all Indian breeds are in the other. There was little indication of breed clustering within either lineage. Application of a molecular clock suggests that the two major mtDNA clades diverged at least 200,000, and possibly as much as 1 million, years ago. This relatively large divergence is interpreted most simply as evidence for two separate domestication events, presumably of different subspecies of the aurochs, Bos primigenius. The clustering of all African zebu mtDNA sequences within the taurine lineage is attributed to ancestral crossbreeding with the earlier B. taurus inhabitants of the continent.},

Phylogenetic reconstruction and multivariate analysis highlighted a marked distinction between humpless (taurine) and humped (zebu) cattle, providing strong support for a separate origin for domesticated zebu cattle. A molecular clock calculation using bison (Bison sp.) as an outgroup gave an estimated divergence time between the two subspecies of 610,000-850,000 years. Substantial differences in the distribution of alleles at 10 of these loci were observed between zebu and taurine cattle. These markers subsequently proved very useful for investigations of gene flow and admixture in African populations. When these data we considered in conjunction with previous mitochondrial and Y chromosomal studies, a distinctive male-mediated pattern of zebu genetic introgression was revealed. The introgression of zebu-specific alleles in African cattle afforded a high resolution perspective on the hybrid culture nature of African cattle populations and also suggested that certain West African populations of valuable disease-tolerant taurine cattle are under threat of genetic absorption by migrating zebu herds.},

Numerous different variations were identified, 62.24% of the total single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in Gayal were novel and 16,901 breed-specific nonsynonymous SNPs (BS-nsSNPs) that might be associated with traits of interest in Gayal were further investigated. Moreover, the demographic history of bovine species was first analyzed and two population expansions and two population bottlenecks were identified. The obvious differences among their population sizes supported that Gayal was not B. taurus. The phylogenic analysis suggested that Gayal was a hybrid descendant from crossing of male wild gaur and female domestic cattle. These discoveries will provide valuable genomic information regarding potential genomic markers that could predict traits of interest for breeding programs of these cattle breeds and may assist relevant departments with future conservation and utilization of Gayal.},

    abstract = {The age at which a human environment was made is strongly debated in Quaternary science. The perception of the human footprint requires an understanding of the contrast between the present cultural environment and the natural vegetation. This is especially true for high altitude ecosystems, such as the world's largest alpine ecosystem, the 450,000 km2 of golf-course-like pastures dominating the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. This ecosystem is widely considered to be natural, but only because of the unawareness of the effects of grazing management and the incorrect assessment of human signals in palaeo proxies. Here we posit the hypothesis that this ecosystem is a human-induced replacement. To test our hypothesis against defined a priori criteria, we 1) monitored vegetation in grazing exclosures; 2) produced floristically complete vegetation records; 3) compared the vegetation records with data of the nearest climate stations; 4) surveyed forest and experimental reforestation trials with endemic tree species; 5) analyzed pollen and re-evaluated published pollen diagrams; and 6) integrated these results with palaeopedological and anthracological results of previous studies. The results of long-term grazing exclosure experiments, the prevalence of grazing-adapted plant functional types, the occurrence of isolated vigorous forests in “alpine” pastures, and the successful reforestation trials in presently treeless pastures together suggest that dominant pastures replaced forests in the montane belt and tall grassland in the alpine belt. The spatial and temporal coincidence of palaeosols and archaeological sites with tree species charcoal, the decline in forest pollen during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum, and the first appearance of human indicator pollen are most parsimoniously explained by the early presence of foragers and pastoralists. The onset of pastoralism in the Tibetan Highlands is presumed to date from the 8th millennium BP.},

    abstract = {The Tibetan highlands host one of the world's largest pastoral ecosystems, but the evolutionary impact of the Tibetan nomadic livestock economy on the environment has not yet been investigated. Despite this grazing impact, the vegetation of the Tibetan highlands is widely believed to be natural. Our ecological approach to reconstructing the making of a pastoral environment uses the present composition of the plant cover as a baseline. Today's prevailing plant functional types are grazing weeds highly adapted to grazing. The first pollen record of grazing weeds can thus be assumed to mark the onset of pastoralism, supposedly with goats and sheep introduced from the Middle East and the endemic large bovid of the yak, domesticated in the Tibetan highlands. This study represents the first attempt to determine the age of pastoralism with the help of palynomorphs using the indicator-species approach. This is independently corroborated 1) by the synchronous occurrence of pollen clumps indicating disturbance effects from trampling and 2) the precipitous decline of forest pollen on the eastern declivity of the highland during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. As all pollen core sites currently have a climatic potential of forest as demonstrated by fruiting and progenitive forest relicts, it is suggested that early livestock holders continued to burn these forests to obtain pastures. The charcoal record supports this conclusion. It is hypothesized that the making of a pastoral environment in the Tibetan highlands started around 8.8 ka cal BP during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum. As the pattern of arboreal pollen decline at these sites contrasts with δ13C, δ18O, TOC content, C/N ratio, and ostracod assemblages that are independent of rangeland management decisions of early pastoralists, we may conclude that pastoralists took advantage of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum to convert forests into high-yield pastures. Using pollen clumps as a proxy for herbivore load suggests a tenfold higher amount of livestock than of wildlife before the introduction of pastoralism. In contrast to pastoralism in arid environments of the Old World's desert belt, pastoralists in the eastern Tibetan highlands created their own environment transforming forests and tall grassland into the present golf course-like pastures.},

To assess the impact of cattle admixture on domestic yak, we examined 1076 domestic yak from 29 populations collected in China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Russia using mitochondrial DNA and 17 autosomal microsatellite loci. A cattle diagnostic marker-based analysis reveals cattle-specific mtDNA and/or autosomal microsatellite allele introgression in 127 yak individuals from 22 populations. The mean level of cattle admixture across the populations, calculated using allelic information at 17 autosomal microsatellite loci, remains relatively low (mYcattleâ€ƒ=â€ƒ2.66â€ƒÂ±â€ƒ0.53\% and Qcattleâ€ƒ=â€ƒ0.69â€ƒÂ±â€ƒ2.58\%), although it varies a lot across populations as well as among individuals within population. Although the level of cattle admixture shows a clear geographical structure, with higher levels of admixture in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and Mongolian and Russian regions, and lower levels in the Himalayan and Pamir Plateau region, our results indicate that the level of cattle admixture is not significantly correlated with the altitude across geographical regions as well as within geographical region. Although yak-cattle hybridization is primarily driven to produce F1 hybrids, our results show that the subsequent gene flow between yak and cattle took place and has affected contemporary genetic make-up of domestic yak. To protect yak genetic integrity, hybridization between yak and cattle should be tightly controlled.},

We date yak domestication to 7,300 years before present (yr BP), most likely by nomadic people, and an estimated sixfold increase in yak population size by 3,600 yr BP. These dates coincide with two early human population expansions on the QTP during the early-Neolithic age and the late-Holocene, respectively.

    abstract = {Our study provides detailed information on the Lateglacial landscape and vegetation development of Tibet. Based on a suite of geomorphological and palynological proxy data from the Nianbaoyeze Shan on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (33°N/101°E, 3300--4500masl.), we reconstruct the current state as a function of climate history and the longevity of human influence. Study results constrain several major phases of aeolian sedimentation between 50--15ka and various glacier advances during the Late Pleistocene, the Holocene and the Little Ice Age. Increased aeolian deposition was primarily associated with periods of more extensive glacial ice extent. Fluvial and alluvial sediment pulses document an increase of erosion starting at 3926±79calyrB.P., coinciding with cooling (Neoglacial) and a growing anthropo-zoogenic influence. Evidence for periglacial mass movements indicate that the late Holocene cooling started at around 2000calyrB.P., demonstrating increased surface activity under the combined effects of human influence and climate deterioration. The onset of peat growth generally depended on local conditions that include relief, meso-climate and in more recent times also on soil compaction due to animal trampling. We distinguish three initiation periods of peat growth: 12,700--10,400calyrB.P. for flat basins inside last glacial terminal moraines; 7000--5000calyrB.P. for the main valley floors; and 3000--1000calyrB.P. for the higher terrace surfaces. The Holocene vegetation history started with an open landscape dominated by pioneer shrubs along braided rivers (<10,600--9800calyrB.P.), followed by the spreading of conifers (Picea, Juniperus, Abies) and Betula-trees accompanied by a successive closing of the vegetation cover by Poaceae, Cyperaceae and herbs (9800--8300calyrB.P.). First signs of nomadic presence appear as early as 7200calyrB.P., when temperatures were up to 2°C warmer than today. Forest remained very patchy with strong local contrasts. During the following cooling phase (5900--2750calyrB.P.) the natural vegetation was transformed by nomadic grazing to Bistorta-rich Kobresia pygmaea-pastures. Modern nomadic migration routes were established at least 2200 years ago. Overgrazing and trampling led to the shrinking of Bistorta and the spreading of annual weeds. Short-lived cold events (8000, 6200, 3500calyrB.P.) impacted on the vegetation only temporarily. As the transformation of the natural Poaceae-rich vegetation into Kobresia-pastures modified the influence of the Tibetan Plateau (“hot plate”) on the monsoon system, our data even point to an early start of a nomadic (!) Anthropocene nearly 6000 years ago. Against the background of a very long grazing history, modern Tibet must be seen as a cultural landscape.},

    abstract = {Abstract Aim We aimed to examine the phylogeographical structure and demographic history of domestic and wild yaks (Bos grunniens) based on a wide range of samples and complete mitochondrial genomic sequences. Location The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of western China. Methods All available D-loop sequences for 405 domesticated yaks and 47 wild yaks were examined, including new sequences from 96 domestic and 34 wild yaks. We further sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of 48 domesticated and 21 wild yaks. Phylogeographical analyses were performed using the mitochondrial D-loop and the total genome datasets. Results We recovered a total of 123 haplotypes based on the D-loop sequences in wild and domestic yaks. Phylogenetic analyses of this dataset and the mitochondrial genome data suggested three well-supported and divergent lineages. Two lineages with six D-loop haplogroups were recovered for all morphological breeds of domestic yaks across their distributions in the QTP, while one more lineage and more endemic haplogroups or haplotypes were found for wild yaks. Based on the mitochondrial genome data, the divergences of the three lineages were estimated to have occurred around 420,000 and 580,000 years ago, consistent with the geological records of two large glaciation events experienced in the QTP. Main conclusions There are distinct phylogeographical differences between wild and domestic yaks. However, there is no apparent geographical correlation between identified haplogroups and distributions of domestic yaks. Three differentiated lineages of yaks probably evolved allopatrically in different regions during the Pleistocene glaciation events, then reunited into a single gene pool during post-glacial population expansion and migrations before the start of the domestication of yaks in the Holocene.},

    abstract = {Species of the Bos genus, including taurine cattle, zebu, gayal, gaur, banteng, yak, wisent and bison, have been domesticated at least four times and have been an important source of meat, milk and power for many human cultures. We sequence the genomes of gayal, gaur, banteng, wisent and bison, and provide population genomic sequencing of an additional 98 individuals. We use these data to determine the phylogeny and evolutionary history of these species and show that the threatened gayal is an independent species or subspecies. We show that there has been pronounced introgression among different members of this genus, and that it in many cases has involved genes of considerable adaptive importance. For example, genes under domestication selection in cattle (for example, MITF) were introgressed from domestic cattle to yak. Also, genes in the response-to-hypoxia pathway (for example, EGLN1, EGLN2 and HIF3a) have been introgressed from yak to Tibetan cattle, probably facilitating their adaptation to high altitude. We also validate that there is an association between the introgressed EGLN1 allele and haemoglobin and red blood cell concentration. Our results illustrate the importance of introgression as a source of adaptive variation and during domestication, and suggest that the Bos genus evolves as a complex of genetically interconnected species with shared evolutionary trajectories.},

This dataset is used to compare several models for the geographical origins of rice cultivation and infer the most likely region(s) for its origins and subsequent outward diffusion. The approach is based on regression modelling wherein goodness of fit is obtained from power law quantile regressions of the archaeologically inferred age versus a least-cost distance from the putative origin(s). The Fast Marching method is used to estimate the least-cost distances based on simple geographical features. The origin region that best fits the archaeobotanical data is also compared to other hypothetical geographical origins derived from the literature, including from genetics, archaeology and historical linguistics. The model that best fits all available archaeological evidence is a dual origin model with two centres for the cultivation and dispersal of rice focused on the Middle Yangtze and the Lower Yangtze valleys.},

    abstract = {The transition from a foraging subsistence strategy to a sedentary farming society is arguably the greatest innovation in human history. Some modern-day groups—specifically the Basques—have been argued to be a remnant population that connect back to the Paleolithic. We present, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide sequence data from eight individuals associated with archaeological remains from farming cultures in the El Portalón cave (Atapuerca, Spain). These individuals emerged from the same group of people as other Early European farmers, and they mixed with local hunter--gatherers on their way to Iberia. The El Portalón individuals showed the greatest genetic affinity to Basques, which suggests that Basques and their language may be linked with the spread of agriculture across Europe. The consequences of the Neolithic transition in Europe—one of the most important cultural changes in human prehistory—is a subject of great interest. However, its effect on prehistoric and modern-day people in Iberia, the westernmost frontier of the European continent, remains unresolved. We present, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide sequence data from eight human remains, dated to between 5,500 and 3,500 years before present, excavated in the El Portalón cave at Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain. We show that these individuals emerged from the same ancestral gene pool as early farmers in other parts of Europe, suggesting that migration was the dominant mode of transferring farming practices throughout western Eurasia. In contrast to central and northern early European farmers, the Chalcolithic El Portalón individuals additionally mixed with local southwestern hunter--gatherers. The proportion of hunter--gatherer-related admixture into early farmers also increased over the course of two millennia. The Chalcolithic El Portalón individuals showed greatest genetic affinity to modern-day Basques, who have long been considered linguistic and genetic isolates linked to the Mesolithic whereas all other European early farmers show greater genetic similarity to modern-day Sardinians. These genetic links suggest that Basques and their language may be linked with the spread of agriculture during the Neolithic. Furthermore, all modern-day Iberian groups except the Basques display distinct admixture with Caucasus/Central Asian and North African groups, possibly related to historical migration events. The El Portalón genomes uncover important pieces of the demographic history of Iberia and Europe and reveal how prehistoric groups relate to modern-day people.},

They adduce evidence from linguistics, archaeology, and genetics to support their claim. An admirable feature of the Robbeets et al.{\textquoteright}s paper is that all their datasets can be accessed. However, a closer investigation of all three types of evidence reveals fundamental problems with each of them. Robbeets et al.{\textquoteright}s analysis of the linguistic data does not conform to the minimal standards required by traditional scholarship in historical linguistics and contradicts their own stated sound correspondence principles. A reanalysis of the genetic data finds that they do not conclusively support the farming-driven dispersal of Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic, nor the two-wave spread of farming to Korea. Their archaeological data contain little phylogenetic signal, and we failed to reproduce the results supporting their core hypotheses about migrations. Given the severe problems we identify in all three parts of the "triangulation" process, we conclude that there is neither conclusive evidence for a Transeurasian language family nor for associating the five different language families with the spread of Neolithic farmers from the West Liao River region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {Language evolution is traditionally described in terms of family trees with ancestral languages splitting into descendent languages. However, it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process—akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution—that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5\%) known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373 (61\%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their history. Our approach correctly identified 117 (94\%) known borrowings. Reconstructed phylogenetic networks that capture both vertical and horizontal components of evolutionary history reveal that, on average, eight per cent of the words of basic vocabulary in each Indo-European language were involved in borrowing during evolution. Basic vocabulary is often assumed to be relatively resistant to borrowing. Our results indicate that the impact of borrowing is far more widespread than previously thought.},
